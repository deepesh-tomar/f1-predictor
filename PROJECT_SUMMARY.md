# 🏎️ F1 Driver Team Switch Predictor - Project Summary

## 🎯 Original Question Addressed

**"For the 2025 season, if few drivers have changed their team, how given a particular race, I want to predict how this driver will perform in this new team based on driver previous history and new team's previous history."**

## ✅ Solution Delivered

I've created a comprehensive **machine learning system** that predicts driver performance when switching teams by analyzing:

### 🔍 **Driver History Analysis**
- Recent performance trends (last 10 races)
- Average finishing positions
- Podium and points finish rates
- Qualifying performance consistency
- Lap time consistency
- Years of experience and career progression

### 🏁 **Team Capability Analysis**
- Recent team performance metrics
- Team reliability and finish rates
- Qualifying performance trends
- Team experience and stability
- Historical performance patterns

### 🏟️ **Circuit-Specific Factors**
- Track experience and history
- Circuit-specific performance patterns
- Historical results at specific venues

## 🚀 What You Can Do Now

### 1. **Interactive Predictions**
```bash
python interactive_predictor.py
```
- Choose any driver from 861 available drivers
- Select any team from 212 available teams
- Pick any circuit from 92 available circuits
- Get instant predictions with confidence scores

### 2. **Programmatic Analysis**
```python
from driver_team_switch_predictor import DriverTeamSwitchPredictor

predictor = DriverTeamSwitchPredictor()
predictor.load_data()
predictor.train_model()

# Predict specific scenario
prediction = predictor.predict_driver_performance(
    driver_id=1,      # Any driver ID
    new_constructor_id=6,  # Any team ID
    circuit_id=1      # Any circuit ID
)
```

### 3. **Team Switch Impact Analysis**
```python
# Compare performance before and after team switch
predictor.analyze_team_switch_scenario(
    driver_id=1,           # Driver
    old_constructor_id=1,  # Old team
    new_constructor_id=6,  # New team
    circuit_id=1           # Circuit
)
```
